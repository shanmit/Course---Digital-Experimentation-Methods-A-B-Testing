# Course-Digital-Experimentation-Methods-A/B Testing

These course materials are specifically designed for teaching Master's students at HKU Business School, centering on the principles and practices of A/B testing. I aim to extend their usefulness to a wider audience, encompassing both learners and educators in the field of A/B testing. The materials include both lecture notes and class exercises in Python. You could easily develop assignments based on the class exercises. 

The course has been meticulously developed from the ground up, ensuring that all content is original. Notably, these materials incorporate insights from 'Kohavi et al. (2020)', blended with my personal experiences and professional collaborations, particularly with the WeChat A/B testing team at Tencent, China.

Course Roadmap:

1. A comprehensive overview of AB testing

2. Statistics behind A/B testing 
* Statistical tests (t, z, chi-square)
* Confidence intervals
* Type I error & Multiple Testing
* Type II Error & Power Analysis
* Regression 

3. Internal & External Validity
* SUTVA (network interferences)
* Survivorship bias
* Sanity Checks (SRM, Randomisation checks, A/A tests)
* Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)

4. Improve Sensitivity 
* Ratio metrics (e.g., lift etc.)
* Increase N (pooled control group, split sample)
* Increase effect size (Triggering Experiments)
* Reduce variance (transform metrics and interleaving design)
* Stratification (post and at assignment)
* Regression with controls, CUPED
* Paired Design, Block Design

5. Observational Causal Studies
* Interrupted time series (ITS)
* Regression discontinuity design (RDD)
* Difference-in-Difference (DID)
* Propensity score matching (PSM)
