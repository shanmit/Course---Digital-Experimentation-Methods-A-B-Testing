# Course-Digital-Experimentation-Methods-A/B-Testing

These course materials are specifically designed for teaching Master's students at HKU Business School, centering on the principles and practices of A/B testing. I aim to extend their usefulness to a wider audience, encompassing both learners and educators in the field of A/B testing.

The course has been meticulously developed from the ground up, ensuring that all content is original. Notably, these materials incorporate insights from 'Kohavi et al. (2020)', blended with my personal experiences and professional collaborations, particularly with the WeChat A/B testing team at Tencent, China.
